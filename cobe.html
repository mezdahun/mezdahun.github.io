								</span>Collective behavior is often studied across various scales and environments, using both mathematical models with subsequent
									agent-based simulations and observations of biological agents.
									Motivated by synthetic collective intelligence, these models serve as a foundation for designing artificial agents, such as robots.
									These agents are used to test the model's robustness in the physical world and to achieve practical applications.
									Throughout this workflow,
									numerous environmental gaps emerge that must be bridged: from observations of animals in the physical world to simulated agents, and then back
									to the physical world with robotic agents. CoBe is a platform designed to bridge these gaps by providing a unified environment for
									humans, simulated agents, and robots to explore the role of embodiment in collective behavior. <br><br><br></p>


								<p><span class="image right-large"><img src="images/cobehuman.jpg" alt="" />
								</span> CoBe is an augmented reality setup to connect simulated and physical worlds. It is a set of projectors and cameras
									spatially distributed on a scaffold around an active arena
									connected via a controller station. CoBe detects dedicated objects, adjusts the underlying simulation environment
									based on their positions, and projects these changes back into the arena, creating a dynamic, interactive space.
									CoBe can be flexibly modified to detect any object and run any real-time simulation defining the environment to be
									projected.
									In its default mode CoBe runs the computational model of <a href="https://www.scienceofintelligence.de/people/palina-bartashevich/">Dr. Palina Bartashevich</a> exploring predator-prey
									interactions in simulated groups of fish. Consequently CoBe projects a school of virtual fish that move within
									the arena. Humans can interact with the group of prey via a special staff representing a predator for the virtual
									fish, to which they react with collective escape behavior also exhibited by real fish. Thus a human or
									multiple humans can act as predator(s) in the system and try to control the fish school.
								<br></p>

								<p><span class="image left-large"><img src="images/cobethymio.png" alt="" />
								</span>The system has been extended to support Thymio II robots. In this case robots can
									sense the projected fish swarm either via their cameras (decentralized) or via a central
									information node (centralized position coordinates). The robots then can behave in the physical world
									interacting with the simulated fish.
									By integrating robots in CoBe we have the
									unique possibility to bridge the gap between simulated and physical agents, and,
									among others, (1) to study the differences between centralized and decentralized control,
									(2) to quantify the effect of perceptual noise on agent behavior or (3) to explore
									the effect of physical constraints such as movement limitations coming from the embodiment of agents. Furthermore
									CoBe can also simplify experimentation with robot collectives. In our case, from the 2 different types of agents (predators
									and prey) we only need to physically engineer one of them keeping the problem tractable.</p>

								</span>
									CoBe also serves as a tool for scientific outreach. The visualization of simulated fish was inspired
									by observations from the Gulf of Mexico, where the interactions between blue marlins and
									mackerels inspired the underlying mathematical model. As a tool for scientific communication,
									CoBe incorporates multiple artistic elements. The fish in the school are individually animated
									by <a href="https://de.linkedin.com/in/davidjohjames">David James</a>, adding dynamism to the visualization.
									Moreover, the background music, specifically composed for CoBe by <a href="https://www.muizyu.com/"> Mui Zyu</a> and <a href="https://de.linkedin.com/in/natalie-szende-3b4b99229"> Natalie Szende</a>, enhances the audiovisual experience.
									This collaboration aims to create an immersive environment that bridges science and art, inviting
									deeper engagement with the simulated ecosystem.
